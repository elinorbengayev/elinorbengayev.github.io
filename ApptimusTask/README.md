# ApptimusTask
The following script enables to add banners to a page and save/clear them to/from localStorage.
Note: I've used JavaScript conventions and used camelCase for identifier names although in the task description the parameters are lowercased (this is best practice).

You can see it in practice [here](https://elinorbengayev.github.io/ApptimusTask/) .
